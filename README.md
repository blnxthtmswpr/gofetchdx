# gofetchdx
gofetchdx is the sequel to gofetch, which was my previous neofetch alternative. This version adds features such as,
if you're on Linux, distro and DE detection.

## Why did you make a new project?
I hadn't updated gofetch in quite a while and there are many other projects named gofetch, so I wanted mine
to be easily searchable on GitHub.

## Why isn't it written in Go?
I wasn't thinking about that when I named the original project. Looking back, it was probably a poor naming
decision.
